# Pinch-zoom
This is a python project based on real-time hand-gesture detection, to zoom in or out, using the distance between the index finger and the thumb. 
It's based on OpenCV, Mediapipe and pyautogui. 
MediaPipe offers open source cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media, created by Google.
Pyautogui is used to communicate with the keyboard and mouse, and control them by python.

To start using this, clone this repository and run following commands to install the required python modules:
 
 **pip install opencv**
 
 **pip install time**
 
 **pip install mediapipe**
 
 **pip install pyautogui**


Then, run
[pinchZoom.py](https://github.com/aspirin01/pinch-zoom-opencv-ML/blob/main/pinchZoom.py)
to start camera and use your index and thumb fingers to pinch zoom on an area. 

Press any key to exit.
